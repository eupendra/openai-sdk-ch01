# OpenAI SDK + Responses API Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use the OpenAI SDK with the new `responses` API for building AI-powered applications.

Unlike the traditional `chat.completions` API, the `responses` API handles memory management for you. You no longer need to resend the full chat history to maintain contextâ€”just pass the `response_id` to continue the conversation.

## What's Covered

- Installing and setting up the OpenAI SDK
- Using `.env` files to manage your API key securely
- Sending prompts using `responses.create()`
- Comparing `chat.completions` and `responses`
- Understanding how `response_id` enables contextual memory
